# 1. Write a statement that concatenates at least two variables (you can have more than 2 for this practice).
# use the string and integer functions, no arithmetic will be allowed for this exercise (i.e. - x*y), 
# combine two variables for a string a variable. The key word here is CONCATENATE.

name = input("What is your name? ")
num_siblings = input("How many siblings do you have? ")
print ("Your name is " + str(name) + " and you have " + str(num_siblings) + " siblings")
